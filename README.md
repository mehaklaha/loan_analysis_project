# loan_analysis_project
A jupyter notebook project repo for Shodh AI Hiring that uses Deep Learning Prediction Analysis for Loan Analysis using Strategic Models and a concise dataset
Loan Risk Assessment and Value Optimization

Project Overview

This repository contains the end-to-end analysis for automated loan decision-making using historical data (2007-2018).

The core objective is to move beyond simple default prediction (risk mitigation) toward profit optimization by comparing standard classification models against advanced sequential decision-making policies (Reinforcement Learning).

Key Tasks Completed (As per the Notebooks)

Data Exploration & Cleaning: Comprehensive EDA and handling of missing values.

Feature Engineering: Creation of new predictive features (e.g., debt-to-income ratios).

Model Building: Training and evaluation of a Deep Learning Predictor (Task 2) and an Offline RL Agent (Task 3).

Strategic Comparison (Task 4): Comparative analysis of statistical performance (AUC) vs. financial utility (Simulated Profit).
